Overview
This Schedule Optimizer is a web application designed to help students create optimized course schedules before the course registration period begins. The app allows students to input their preferred courses, view available time slots, and optimize their schedules based on various constraints like teacher availability, course prerequisites, and personal preferences. It also scrapes real-time course information and teacher ratings to provide the best course options. It only supports Vanier College courses as of right now.
