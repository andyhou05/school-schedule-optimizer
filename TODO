ESSENTIAL:

- Change section state to courseform instead of listitem
- Clean codebase (remove userInput and use reducer for inputCourses instead, update userInput on form submission, folders components, change inputCourses to userChoices...)
- Preserve form state for user input (section numbers, keep track of section value and section input)
- Rate My Teacher links clickable
- Check for time errors on Course Form
- Show not found page for 0 schedules
- Button to go back
- Remove duplicate periods in db
- Change cell colors based on teacher rating
- Add text to all tooltips
- Add text saying request may take minutes

CODE STRUCTURE:

- Convert Start, End, Duration time on the backend
- Put each component in its own folder
- avoid antipatterns, minimize inital load time
- Remove useless server routes
- Handle errors better
